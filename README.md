# About ParcelJS

ParcelJs seems very inspiring new bundler after webpack, here in this application
for running Vue and React app i have not done any for bundler only config file here i use
is of babel.
Parceljs has taken all the pain of configuration and will let you code directly

There seems still some bug with parcel vue plugin and other minor issues, hope it gonna be fix soon.
